# brain-tumor-detection-cnn
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect brain tumors from MRI images. It classifies scans as 'tumor' or 'no tumor' using Keras and TensorFlow, with image augmentation and visualized training metrics. Ideal for medical image analysis and deep learning beginners.
